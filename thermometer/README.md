# Overview

The thermometer is a temperature sensor connected to a 32 character LCD display. The temperature shown is in Fahrenheit. There is also a counter next to `Hello, World!`. The reason I kept the `Hello, World!` string along with the counter was to show how it's possible to individually target each character in the LCD display. Another novel part of this project was the use of the digital pins on the LCD board. Most of the modules we've used have just on/off pins. But we used data pins 4-7 on the LCD.

## Getting Started

Ensure you have the `LiquidCrystal` loaded to your IDE. This library came preset with the Arduino IDE.
